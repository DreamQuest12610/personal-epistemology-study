# My Personal Epistemology: Deep Self-Examination

**Date:**  04-12-25
**Purpose:** To understand my own epistemological stance so I can recognize when I'm judging participants against it.

## Part 1: Hofer & Pintrich Self-Assessment

### Dimension 1: Certainty of Knowledge

**Question: Is knowledge fixed or evolving?**

**My position:**
- [Where do I fall on this spectrum?]

**Evidence from my life:**
- Times I've held onto "settled" knowledge stubbornly:
- Times I've revised my understanding:
- How comfortable am I with knowledge changing?
- What kinds of knowledge do I see as stable vs. fluid?

**How this might bias me:**
- I might [overvalue/undervalue] participants who see knowledge as [certain/uncertain]
- I might mishear [X kind of statement] as [Y] because of my bias toward [Z]

---

### Dimension 2: Simplicity of Knowledge

**Question: Is knowledge discrete facts or interconnected systems?**

**My position:**
- [Do I see knowledge as building blocks or webs?]

**Evidence from my life:**
- How do I organize information in my mind?
- When I learn something new, do I categorize it or integrate it?
- Example: When I read Hofer & Pintrich, did I see "four separate dimensions" or "one integrated framework"?

**My actual answer:**
- [Be honest about your pattern-seeking, system-building tendency]

**How this might bias me:**
- As someone who [sees patterns/connections everywhere], I might:
  - Assume others see connections I see
  - Miss that some people really do think in discrete chunks
  - Impose my integrative thinking on their more modular approach

---

### Dimension 3: Source of Knowledge

**Question: Does knowledge come from external authority or personal construction?**

**My position:**
- [Where do I actually trust knowledge comes from?]

**Honest examination:**
- When I use Claude to understand frameworks, am I:
  - Trusting external authority? (Claude knows, I'm learning from it)
  - Constructing personally? (I'm using Claude to build my own understanding)
  - Something in between?

- When Hofstadter contradicted Searle, did I:
  - Trust Hofstadter's authority?
  - Evaluate both arguments and construct my position?
  - Trust the one that felt more intuitive?

- When my ISTJ colleague helped with copyright paper, did I:
  - Defer to their expertise?
  - Critically evaluate their suggestions?
  - Construct collaborative understanding?

**My actual pattern:**
- [What do I actually do, not what I think I should do?]

**How this might bias me:**
- I might [overvalue/undervalue] participants who [trust authority/construct personally]
- I might not recognize [X approach] as valid knowing because I [Y]

---

### Dimension 4: Justification for Knowing

**Question: How do I warrant knowledge claims?**

**My honest answer about MY process:**

**When I "know" something, it's usually because:**
1. [Rank these honestly]
   - I've verified it systematically
   - I've reasoned through it logically
   - I recognize the pattern (intuition)
   - An authority I trust said it
   - It fits coherently with other things I know
   - I've experienced it directly
   - I just... know (can't explain)

**Specific examples:**
- I knew Hofer & Pintrich was right framework because: [Why really?]
- I know IPA is appropriate methodology because: [Why really?]
- I know my ISTJ colleague is systematic because: [Why really? Have I verified this or assumed it?]
- I know Searle is right about Chinese Room because: [Why really? Experience with LLMs? Or something else?]

**My justification hierarchy (honest):**
1. [What I trust most]
2. [What I trust second]
3. [What I trust least]

**How this might bias me:**
- Because I primarily justify through [X], I might:
  - Undervalue participants who justify through [Y]
  - Not recognize [Y] as legitimate knowing
  - Push them toward [X] in my follow-up questions

---

## Part 2: My Position on Key Debates

### Searle's Chinese Room

**My current position:**
- [Do I think syntax = semantics or not?]
- [Does understanding require something more than symbol manipulation?]
- [Can pattern-matching at scale constitute genuine knowing?]

**Why I hold this position:**
- [Honest: Is it because of arguments or because of experience with AI?]
- [What would change my mind?]

**How this affects how I hear participants:**
- If someone says "I just know through pattern recognition," will I hear that as:
  - Legitimate knowing? (Hofstadter view)
  - Symbol manipulation without understanding? (Searle view)
- If someone says "I need to understand the process," will I hear that as:
  - Unnecessary verification? (if I'm Hofstadter-leaning)
  - Proper epistemic rigor? (if I'm Searle-leaning)

---

### Intuition vs. Verification

**My honest position:**
- [Which do I actually trust more?]

**Evidence:**
- In my own research, when I "just know" something is right (like choosing Hofer & Pintrich), do I:
  - Trust that intuition and act on it?
  - Feel compelled to verify it systematically?
  - Both but one feels more legitimate?

**My actual pattern:**
- [Be specific about recent examples]

**What I judge:**
- [Do I secretly think intuition without verification is lazy?]
- [Do I secretly think excessive verification is insecure?]
- [Be honest about my judgments]

**How this will bias me:**
- [Specific predictions about how I'll mishear participants]

## Part 3: My Relationship with MBTI

### Why MBTI Appeals to Me

**Honest answers:**
1. [Pattern-seeking and categorization scratch an INTP itch?]
2. [Reduces anxiety about unpredictability of humans?]
3. [Makes me feel like I understand people without messy relationships?]
4. [Intellectualizes social interaction?]
5. [Gives me framework to avoid vulnerability of genuine curiosity?]

**Be brutally honest:**
- [What psychological need does MBTI serve for me?]

---

### What MBTI Has Cost Me

**Times I've been wrong:**
1. [Specific example of misreading someone because of type assumptions]
2. [Time I missed something important because I'd already categorized them]
3. [Relationship that suffered because I treated them as type not person]

**What I've missed:**
- [Complexity I didn't see]
- [Contradictions I explained away]
- [Individuals I reduced to categories]

---

### My Fear Without MBTI

**If I completely let go of type-thinking, what am I afraid of?**
- [Uncertainty?]
- [Not knowing who someone is before talking to them?]
- [Having to be genuinely present and curious?]
- [Losing predictive control?]
- [Being surprised or wrong?]

**THIS IS THE CORE ISSUE.**

**COMMITMENT:** I will sit with this discomfort rather than reaching for type categories.

## Part 4: My Epistemological Autobiography

### How I Came to Think the Way I Do

**Early experiences that shaped my epistemology:**
- [Formative moments about knowledge/truth/certainty]
- [Teachers or authorities who influenced me]
- [Times I was wrong and how I responded]
- [Times I was right and what that felt like]

**My intellectual heroes and what they represent:**
- Hofstadter: [What does his appeal say about my epistemology?]
- HPMOR/rationalist community: [What epistemological stance does this represent?]
- Proust, Rumi, Lao Tzu: [How do these fit with rationalist interests?]

**Wait—this is interesting:**
- I love both rationalist/systematic thinkers AND mystics/poets
- What does this tension say about my epistemology?
- Am I more complex than my type suggests?
- [Explore this contradiction]

---

### My Current Epistemological Crisis

**The Claude Question:**
- I'm using AI that I think doesn't really understand
- To help me understand things I don't yet understand
- What does this say about my epistemology?
- How do I know when I've genuinely learned vs. just learned to perform?

**This is my version of what my participants might be experiencing.**

**How can I listen to their epistemological crises when I'm in the middle of my own?**

**Answer:** [Maybe that's the point—shared experience creates empathy]

---

## Part 5: Predictions About My Bias Patterns

### When Will I Fail to Bracket?

**I will likely impose my view when:**
- [Participant says something that triggers my own insecurity]
- [Participant's approach threatens my epistemic comfort]
- [I'm tired or anxious]
- [Participant is like me and I want to see confirmation]
- [Participant is unlike me and I want to see contrast]

**Specific scenarios where I'll struggle:**
1. If ISTJ colleague dismisses intuition entirely, I might:
   - Feel defensive about my own intuitive leaps
   - Push back rather than understanding their view
   - Look for contradictions to "prove them wrong"

2. If ENFP colleague can't articulate justification for knowing, I might:
   - Judge that as intellectually lazy
   - Miss the legitimacy of embodied/tacit knowing
   - Try to force them into analytical framework

3. If either uses AI differently than I expect, I might:
   - Impose my Searle-influenced view
   - Not hear their actual relationship with tools
   - Project my own crisis onto them

---

## Part 6: Commitment to Genuine Curiosity

### What I'm Actually Curious About (No Types)

**Real questions I have:**
1. How do different people experience the feeling of "knowing"?
2. What does uncertainty feel like for different people?
3. How do people who think differently than me make sense of the world?
4. What can I learn about epistemology that I can't access through introspection alone?

**These are the questions that will guide me.**

Not: "Do ISTJs verify more than ENFPs?"

But: "How does THIS person experience knowing?"

---

## Part 7: My Reflexivity Practice

### Before Each Interview

**I will remind myself:**
- I don't know this person as well as I think I do
- My categories are my anxiety, not their reality
- Genuine curiosity feels uncomfortable—that's okay
- Being surprised is the goal, not confirming predictions

### During Each Interview

**When I catch myself type-thinking, I will:**
1. Mentally note: "type-thinking"
2. Return to their words
3. Ask: "Tell me more about that"

### After Each Interview

**I will ask myself:**
- What surprised me? (If nothing, I wasn't listening)
- What confirmed my expectations? (Am I seeing what I want to see?)
- What contradicted my expectations? (Did I explore it or explain it away?)
- What did I miss because of my bias?
