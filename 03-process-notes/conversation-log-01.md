# Conversation Log 01: Initial Conceptualization

**Date:** [Today's date]
**Context:** Brainstorming research design with AI assistant

## Key Developments

### 1. Initial Problem Identification

**Started with:** Vague idea about studying colleagues' views on AI tools
- Two ex-colleagues: ENFP (intuitive, low ambition) and ISTJ (skeptical of AI)
- Initial thought: study their take on AI tools for research

**Issues identified:**
- Too focused on AI specifically
- MBTI framework problematic as research framework
- Unclear what the real question was

### 2. Reframing Around Epistemology

**Breakthrough moment:** Realized the core question wasn't about AI, but about **"How do we know what we know?"**

This connects to:
- HPMOR's fundamental question of rationality
- My own interests in epistemology and knowledge
- The professional work librarians do (teaching information literacy = teaching epistemology)

**Key insight:** AI makes epistemological differences visible, but the differences exist regardless of AI

### 3. Discovering Personal Epistemology as Field

**Search revealed:** This is an established research area!
- Called "personal epistemology" or "epistemic cognition"
- Studied in education, medicine, nursing
- NOT yet studied phenomenologically in librarianship

**Major models identified:**
- Perry Scheme (developmental, sequential stages)
- Schommer's Model (dimensional, 5 dimensions)
- Hofer & Pintrich Model (dimensional, 4 dimensions)

**Decision:** Hofer & Pintrich most appropriate because:
- Focused on epistemology specifically
- Dimensional (not forcing developmental stages)
- Well-cited in professional contexts
- Clean structure

### 4. Methodology Selection

**IPA (Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis) chosen because:**
- Perfect for small sample (3-4 participants)
- Explores lived experience of complex phenomena
- Allows depth over breadth
- Established methodology with clear procedures

**Alternative considered:**
- Survey-based quantitative (rejected: loses depth, requires large sample)
- Other qualitative methods (grounded theory, narrative analysis) - IPA best fit for epistemology exploration

### 5. Theory vs. Model vs. Methodology Confusion

**Clarification needed:**
- **Theory** = broad philosophical framework (WHY study this)
- **Model** = specific conceptual structure (WHAT to look for)
- **Methodology** = research procedures (HOW to investigate)

**For this study:**
- Theory: Personal Epistemology + Situated Cognition
- Model: Hofer & Pintrich's Four Dimensions
- Methodology: IPA

### 6. The Agency Connection

**Late addition:** Agency emerged as important theme
- Epistemology and agency are connected
- Can't have genuine agency without understanding basis of knowledge
- Opaque tools threaten both epistemology AND agency
- Makes study more urgent, not just descriptive

**Decision:** Include agency questions but keep epistemology as primary focus

### 7. Interview Question Development

**Iterations:**
- First version: Generic user study questions
- Second version: Epistemology-focused but abstract
- Third version: Mapped to Hofer & Pintrich dimensions
- Fourth version: Added flexibility for participants who can't recall specific examples

**Key insight:** Need escape routes when asking for personal examples - not everyone remembers specific instances

### 8. Communication Challenges

**Personal revelation:** I struggle with spontaneous articulation of complex ideas
- Helped by having written frameworks
- INTP processing style: internal first, external second
- Interview guide serves as scaffolding for me too

### 9. Conversation with ENFP Colleague

**What happened:**
- He immediately engaged with the idea
- Helped me clarify the title/question
- Suggested looking for existing models
- Pointed to cognitive science connection
- Asked about theories vs. methodology

**Breakthrough:** His extroverted intuition helped externalize my introverted intuition
- Both intuitive types but different modes
- Complementary thinking styles
- He helped me articulate what I already intuited

### 10. Documentation Decision

**Realized:** Need to document this process
- Research process itself is valuable
- GitHub chosen for version control and organization
- This file is part of that documentation

## Open Questions

1. How to handle participants who can't provide specific examples?
   - Solution: Build in flexibility, accept abstract responses

2. Should MBTI be mentioned at all?
   - Solution: Use for sampling only, describe as "cognitive diversity," not analyze by type

3. Is sample of 3 enough?
   - Yes for IPA; 4 would be ideal but 3 is acceptable

4. How to recruit INTJ participant?
   - Leverage previous collaboration on copyright paper
   - Frame as intellectual exploration
   - Offer structure (questions in advance)

## Next Steps

- [ ] Finalize interview guide with flexibility built in
- [ ] Set up GitHub repository
- [ ] Contact ENFP for first interview
- [ ] Prepare consent form
- [ ] Set up recording system
- [ ] Review IPA analysis procedures

## Key Learnings

1. **Clarity through conversation:** Sometimes need external processing to understand internal thoughts
2. **Framework reduces anxiety:** Having established models/methods makes research feel less arbitrary
3. **There's no perfect framework:** Just appropriate ones for specific questions
4. **Document the process:** Research is messy; documenting helps
5. **Trust the curiosity:** Started with vague interest, led to coherent research design
