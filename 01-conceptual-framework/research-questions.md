# Research Questions and Objectives

## Primary Research Question

**"How do information professionals with different cognitive orientations conceptualize knowledge and knowing in their professional practice?"**

## Sub-Questions

1. **Nature of Knowledge**
   - How do librarians understand the certainty vs. tentativeness of knowledge?
   - Do they view knowledge as discrete facts or integrated systems?

2. **Nature of Knowing**
   - What do librarians identify as legitimate sources of knowledge?
   - How do they justify knowledge claims in their work?

3. **Practice Manifestation**
   - How do these epistemological beliefs shape professional practice?
   - What happens when tools or situations challenge these beliefs?

4. **Evolution & Context**
   - How have participants' epistemological stances evolved over their careers?
   - How does professional context shape epistemological beliefs?

5. **Agency Connection**
   - How do different epistemological stances relate to professional agency?
   - What happens to agency when tools become opaque (e.g., AI)?

## Study Objectives

1. Explore the phenomenology of epistemological beliefs among practicing librarians
2. Map individual differences in epistemic stances using Hofer & Pintrich framework
3. Understand how epistemological beliefs manifest in professional decision-making
4. Examine the relationship between epistemology and professional agency
5. Contribute to understanding of personal epistemology in information professions

## Scope

**Included:**
- Beliefs about knowledge and knowing
- Professional practice manifestations
- Individual variation in epistemic stances
- Connection to tools/technology

**Excluded:**
- Personality assessment (MBTI used only for sampling diversity, not analysis)
- Quantitative measurement of beliefs
- Causal relationships
- Generalization to all librarians
- Socioeconomic factors
- Psychological traits beyond epistemology

## Contribution

**To Information Science:**
- First qualitative phenomenological study of librarians' personal epistemology
- Bridges cognitive science and information science

**To Personal Epistemology Research:**
- Extends application to information professionals
- Demonstrates IPA methodology in epistemic research

**To Practice:**
- Illuminates why librarians approach problems differently
- Reveals epistemological challenges of new tools
- Informs professional development

## Success Criteria

This study will be successful if it:
1. Generates rich phenomenological data about epistemic beliefs
2. Identifies distinct epistemological stances among participants
3. Reveals how beliefs connect to practice
4. Produces publishable insights
5. Opens questions for future research
