# Theoretical Foundations

## Personal Epistemology: Core Theory

Personal epistemology (also called epistemic cognition or epistemological beliefs) refers to individuals' beliefs about the nature of knowledge and knowing (Hofer & Pintrich, 1997).

### Key Assumptions
1. People hold implicit beliefs about what knowledge is
2. These beliefs shape learning, reasoning, and professional practice
3. Beliefs can be studied empirically
4. Different people may hold different epistemological stances

## Theoretical Layers

### Level 1: Overarching Theory
**Personal Epistemology Theory**
- Knowledge and knowing are not just philosophical abstractions
- People have working theories about epistemology
- These theories manifest in behavior and practice

### Level 2: Conceptual Model
**Hofer & Pintrich's Four-Dimensional Model (1997)**

Two categories with four dimensions:

**Nature of Knowledge:**
1. **Certainty** - Is knowledge fixed/absolute or tentative/evolving?
2. **Simplicity** - Is knowledge discrete facts or integrated/complex?

**Nature of Knowing:**
3. **Source** - Does knowledge come from external authority or is it personally constructed?
4. **Justification** - How are knowledge claims warranted? What counts as evidence?

### Level 3: Contextual Theory
**Situated Cognition**
- Cognition happens in context, not vacuum
- Professional practice shapes and is shaped by epistemological beliefs
- Studying beliefs in situ reveals how they actually function

## Why This Framework?

### Why Personal Epistemology (vs. other theories)?
The core research question is about beliefs regarding knowledge → Personal epistemology is the appropriate domain

### Why Dimensional Model (vs. developmental models like Perry)?
- Not assuming participants are at different developmental stages
- Exploring different configurations of beliefs
- More flexible for phenomenological exploration

### Why Hofer & Pintrich (vs. Schommer)?
- Focused specifically on epistemology (not broader learning beliefs)
- Four clear dimensions
- Most cited in professional context research
- Clean conceptual structure

### Why Situated Cognition?
- Studying beliefs in professional practice context
- Understanding how abstract beliefs manifest in concrete work
- Acknowledging context matters

## Alternative Frameworks Considered

**Perry Scheme (1970):** Developmental model with sequential stages
- **Why not used:** Forces stage assignment; participants may not fit linear progression

**Schommer's Model (1990):** Five-dimensional model including learning beliefs
- **Why not used:** Broader than needed; includes dimensions not central to this study

**Women's Ways of Knowing:** Gender-focused epistemological development
- **Why not used:** Gender not the focus; sample includes multiple genders

## Connection to Professional Practice

Librarians' work is fundamentally epistemological:
- Teaching information literacy = teaching epistemology
- Evaluating sources = applying epistemic criteria
- Research consultation = guiding epistemic processes

Understanding how librarians conceptualize knowledge itself illuminates:
- Why different librarians approach problems differently
- How professional judgment functions
- What happens when tools (like AI) challenge traditional epistemological assumptions

## Open Questions

- How do epistemological beliefs change over career?
- Do different disciplines within LIS have different epistemic cultures?
- How do opaque tools (AI) challenge existing epistemological frameworks?
- Is there relationship between epistemology and professional agency?
