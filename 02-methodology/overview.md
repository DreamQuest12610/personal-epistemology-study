# Methodology Overview

## Approach: Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA)

### What is IPA?

IPA is a qualitative approach that:
- **Phenomenological:** Explores lived experience
- **Interpretative:** Researcher makes sense of participants making sense of experience
- **Idiographic:** Focuses on particular individuals in context

### Why IPA for This Study?

**Match with Research Question:**
- Exploring subjective experience (how librarians conceptualize knowing)
- Complex, ambiguous phenomenon (epistemology is hard to articulate)
- Interested in depth, not breadth

**Alignment with Framework:**
- Hofer & Pintrich's dimensional model allows qualitative exploration
- Not forcing developmental stages
- Can discover nuances beyond the model

**Methodological Appropriateness:**
- Small sample (3-4) is ideal for IPA
- Rich interview data fits IPA analysis
- Inductive while theoretically informed

## Sample

**Size:** 3-4 participants

**Rationale:** IPA typically uses 3-6 participants for a single study, focusing on depth rather than breadth.

**Sampling Strategy:** Purposive sampling for cognitive diversity
- Selecting librarians with different thinking styles
- MBTI used as rough heuristic for diversity, not for analysis
- All participants are information professionals with research responsibilities

**Inclusion Criteria:**
- Practicing librarian or information professional
- Engaged in research support/reference work
- Willing to reflect on epistemological beliefs
- Able to participate in 45-60 minute interview

**Homogeneity:**
- All work in library/information context
- All engage with research and knowledge work

**Heterogeneity:**
- Different cognitive orientations
- Varied career stages possible
- Different institutional contexts possible

## Data Collection

**Method:** Semi-structured interviews

**Duration:** 45-60 minutes each

**Format:** 
- In-person or video call (recorded with consent)
- Conversational, following participant's threads
- Interview guide as flexible framework, not rigid script

**Recording:**
- Audio recording (with consent)
- Brief fieldnotes on context, non-verbal cues

## Data Analysis

**IPA Analysis Process:**

### Step 1: Immersion
- Read and re-read transcript
- Note initial impressions
- Get familiar with participant's language and concerns

### Step 2: Initial Noting
- Descriptive comments (what they said)
- Linguistic comments (how they said it)
- Conceptual comments (what it might mean)

### Step 3: Develop Emergent Themes
- Identify patterns within individual transcript
- Create theme names that capture essence
- Stay close to participant's language

### Step 4: Search for Connections
- Group related themes
- Note oppositions, tensions
- Build structure within case

### Step 5: Move to Next Case
- Bracket previous insights
- Approach fresh
- Repeat steps 1-4

### Step 6: Look for Patterns Across Cases
- Which themes appear across participants?
- Which are unique?
- How do themes relate?

### Step 7: Create Master Theme Structure
- 3-5 superordinate themes
- Sub-themes under each
- Grounded in quotes

## Theoretical Lens

While IPA is inductive, this study is informed by:
- Hofer & Pintrich's four dimensions (certainty, simplicity, source, justification)
- Personal epistemology literature
- Situated cognition theory

**Approach:**
- Use framework to generate questions
- Remain open to themes beyond framework
- Let participants' experience drive analysis

## Quality Criteria

**Validity in IPA:**
- Sensitivity to context
- Commitment and rigor
- Transparency and coherence
- Impact and importance

**This Study:**
- Detailed analytic process documented
- Quotes used to ground interpretations
- Reflexivity practiced throughout
- Alternative interpretations considered

## Ethical Considerations

- Informed consent obtained
- Confidentiality/anonymity offered
- Participants can review their quotes before publication
- Right to withdraw at any time
- Data stored securely

## Limitations

- Small sample (not generalizable)
- Researcher's own epistemology shapes interpretation
- Participants may not have full access to implicit beliefs
- Interview captures moment in time, not evolution
- Selection of quotes is interpretative act

## Reflexivity

As researcher, I bring:
- INTP cognitive style (pattern-seeking, systematic)
- Background in both law and library science
- Interest in epistemology and rationality
- Preference for verification and traceability
- Awareness that my epistemology shapes what I see
