**[DIMENSION: Certainty - fixed vs. evolving]**

*[Listen for: View of knowledge as stable/changing, comfort with revision]*

*Follow-up probes:*
- "Can you think of an example of when your understanding of something shifted?"

**[CROSS-CUTTING: Certainty tolerance + Justification under constraints]**

*[Listen for: Comfort with ambiguity, strategies for dealing with conflicting information]*

*Follow-up:*
- "Does a specific situation come to mind? Can you describe it?"

*[Listen for: Evolution of beliefs, what caused shifts, stability vs. change]*

*Follow-up probes:*
- "What caused those changes?"
- "Are there things you used to be certain about that you're less certain about now? Or vice versa?"

---

*Follow-up:*
- "How do you feel about these changes?"
- "Have they changed how you think about knowledge or research?"

---

---

### SECTION 7: Agency & Professional Identity (5-10 minutes)

**Purpose:** Explore relationship between epistemology and professional agency

**[META: Epistemological pluralism vs. universalism]**

*[Listen for: Recognition of diversity, evaluation of different approaches]*

*Follow-up:*
- "If people do approach it differently, is one way better than others?"

---

### SECTION 9: Closing Reflection (5 minutes)

**Purpose:** Catch what you missed, give participant agency

## Interview Flexibility Guidelines

### Core Principles:

1. **These are guides, not scripts**
   - You don't need to ask every question
   - You can ask them in different order
   - Follow interesting threads even if they go off-script

2. **Adapt to participant's style**
   - Some people give detailed stories (let them talk)
   - Some people are abstract (probe for concrete examples, but accept abstract if that's their mode)
   - Some people struggle with recall (use hypotheticals or general patterns)

3. **Example flexibility**
   - Always invite specific examples first
   - Have backup: "Or just generally, how do you..."
   - If they can't recall: "Imagine a situation where..."
   - Accept abstract responses as data

4. **Listen actively**
   - "Tell me more about that"
   - "That's interesting - can you say more?"
   - "What do you mean by [term they used]?"
   - Use their language back to them

5. **Silence is okay**
   - Let them think
   - Count to 5 before filling silence
   - Deep reflection takes time

6. **Watch for energy**
   - If a topic energizes them, explore more
   - If a topic creates discomfort, notice but don't force
   - If they keep returning to something, that's significant

### Priority Questions (If Time is Limited):

**Must Ask (Core IPA data):**
- Q2 (context)
- Q4 (certainty)
- Q7 (source)
- Q10 (process - this should be longest)
- Q11 (intuition vs. verification)
- Q12 (being wrong)
- Q14 (ambiguity)
- Q20 (agency)
- Q22 (philosophy)
- Q25 (closing reflection)

**These 10 will give you rich data across all dimensions.**

## Reflexivity Notes

### Monitor Your Own Reactions:

**During interview, notice:**
- What surprises you?
- What confirms your assumptions?
- When do you feel agreement/disagreement?
- What makes you uncomfortable?
- What excites you?

**These reactions are data about:**
- Your own epistemology
- Differences between you and participant
- Potential biases in interpretation

**After each interview, document:**
- "I was surprised when they said..."
- "I found myself wanting them to answer differently when..."
- "I resonated with their view that..."
- "I struggled to understand..."
