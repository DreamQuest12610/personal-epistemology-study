# Bracketing Exercise: Pre-Interview Expectations

**Date:** [Today's date]
**Purpose:** To make explicit my expectations about participants so I can consciously set them aside during interviews and analysis.

**IPA Principle:** I must approach each participant with genuine curiosity about THEIR experience, not confirmation of MY theories about who they are.

---

## Participant 1: [Name or Code]

### What I Know About Them (Facts):
- Professional role: 
- Years of experience:
- How I know them:
- Context of our professional relationship:

### My Type-Based Assumptions (To Be Bracketed):
**MBTI Type I've assigned:** [e.g., ISTJ]

**What I expect them to say about knowledge/knowing:**
1. [Specific prediction]
2. [Specific prediction]
3. [Specific prediction]

**Why I expect this (my reasoning):**
- [What about their type makes me think this]
- [What behaviors I've observed that reinforce this]
- [How this fits my theory about types]

**How they'll answer specific questions (my predictions):**
- Q4 (knowledge changes?): I expect they'll say...
- Q11 (intuition vs. verification?): I expect they'll say...
- Q20 (agency with opaque tools?): I expect they'll say...

**Language/metaphors I expect them to use:**
- [Words I think they'll use]
- [Concepts I think matter to them]

### What Might Contradict My Expectations:
**If they said/did this, it would surprise me:**
1.
2.
3.

**COMMITMENT:** I will actively notice and explore these surprises if they occur.

### My Emotional Relationship to This Person:
**How I feel about them professionally:**
- [Respect? Admiration? Frustration? Distance?]

**How this might bias my listening:**
- If I admire them, I might: [uncritically accept their views]
- If I'm distant from them, I might: [look for confirming evidence of difference]

### What I'm Curious About (Genuine Questions):
**Things I genuinely don't know and want to understand:**
1.
2.
3.

**COMMITMENT:** I will let THESE questions guide my interview, not my type-predictions.

## Cross-Participant Expectations (To Be Bracketed)

### How I expect them to differ from each other:
**Participant 1 vs. Participant 2:**
- I expect P1 will emphasize [X] while P2 will emphasize [Y]
- Because [type-based reasoning]

**Participant 2 vs. Participant 3:**
- I expect...

**All together:**
- I expect to see a pattern where...
- I expect the "systematic" people will cluster on...
- I expect the "intuitive" people will cluster on...

### What would disrupt these patterns:
**If I found this, my type theory would be wrong:**
1.
2.
3.

## My Own Epistemological Stance (Self-Awareness)

### How I personally think about knowledge:
**My position on Hofer & Pintrich dimensions:**
- **Certainty:** I believe knowledge is [fixed/evolving/somewhere between]
- **Simplicity:** I see knowledge as [discrete/interconnected]
- **Source:** I trust [authority/personal construction/mix]
- **Justification:** I warrant claims through [verification/intuition/reasoning]

**My position on Searle's question:**
- I believe understanding [requires/doesn't require] grasping process/meaning
- I think AI [does/doesn't] genuinely know
- This affects how I view [intuitive knowing/pattern-matching/authority]

### How my epistemology might bias my interpretations:
**Because I value [X], I might:**
- Over-value participants who share this value
- Under-appreciate alternative approaches
- Mishear or discount evidence that challenges my view

**COMMITMENT:** I will notice when I'm judging participants against my own epistemic standards rather than understanding theirs.

## My Relationship to MBTI (Honesty Check)

### Why MBTI appeals to me:
1. [Be honest: pattern-seeking? Need for categories? Etc.]
2.
3.

### What MBTI has gotten wrong in my experience:
1. [Times people didn't fit their type]
2. [Times I stereotyped incorrectly]
3.

### Why I'm drawn to type-based prediction:
- [Is it anxiety about uncertainty? Need for control? Love of patterns?]

**COMMITMENT:** I recognize that MBTI is a cognitive security blanket for me. I will set it aside and engage with the messiness of real individuals.

## Bracketing Commitments

**During interviews, I commit to:**
1. ✅ Noticing when I think "that's very [TYPE] of them"
2. ✅ Asking "tell me more" when they surprise me
3. ✅ Following their language, not steering toward my predictions
4. ✅ Being genuinely curious about contradictions
5. ✅ Not comparing participants to each other during interviews
6. ✅ Treating each person as if they're the only participant

**During analysis, I commit to:**
1. ✅ Coding their actual words, not my type interpretations
2. ✅ Analyzing each case completely before moving to next
3. ✅ Noting when their phenomenology differs from my expectations
4. ✅ Not organizing findings by "types"
5. ✅ Letting themes emerge rather than imposing categories
6. ✅ Celebrating complexity and contradiction

**Red flags that I'm failing to bracket:**
- ❌ I find myself thinking "just as I expected"
- ❌ I'm not surprised by anything they say
- ❌ I'm mentally categorizing as "the systematic one" vs "the intuitive one"
- ❌ I'm looking for type-confirming evidence
- ❌ I'm dismissing contradictions as anomalies

**If I notice these red flags:**
→ STOP
→ Re-read this bracketing document
→ Refocus on their individual phenomenology
→ Ask myself: "What am I missing because of my preconceptions?"

## Post-Interview Reflection Template

**After each interview, I will write:**

### What Surprised Me:
1.
2.
3.

### What Confirmed My Expectations:
1.
2.
3.

**CRITICAL QUESTION:** Am I only seeing confirmation because I'm looking for it?

### What Contradicted My Expectations:
1.
2.
3.

**CRITICAL QUESTION:** Am I explaining away contradictions or taking them seriously?

### What I Missed (In Hindsight):
- Moments I should have followed up but didn't
- Questions I should have asked
- When I was steering rather than listening

### What I Learned About My Bias:
- Moments I caught myself type-thinking
- How my own epistemology shaped my hearing
- What I need to bracket better next time
