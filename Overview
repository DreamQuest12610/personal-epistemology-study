# Personal Epistemology in Library Practice: An IPA Study

## Overview
This repository documents my research exploring how librarians with different cognitive orientations conceptualize knowledge and knowing in their professional practice.

## Documentation Authorship

**Important Note:** The documentation files in this repository (theoretical frameworks, methodology overviews, literature summaries) were **drafted by Anthropic's Claude ** based on our collaborative conversations about my research interests.

While the **research ideas, questions, and decisions are mine**, the **written articulation in these documents is Claude's language**, not my original prose. I am using these AI-generated documents as:
- Structured scaffolding for my thinking
- Reference material as I develop the project
- Documentation of the conceptual development process

**As the research progresses**, I will:
- Rewrite key sections in my own voice
- Verify all cited frameworks and theories through original sources
- Create my own original analysis and writing for the final output

This repository represents the **conceptual development phase** with AI assistance. The **execution phase** (interviews, analysis, final writing) will be in my own voice and work.

## Research Question
"How do information professionals with different epistemological stances understand the nature of knowledge and knowing, and how do these beliefs manifest in their professional practice?"

## Theoretical Framework
- **Theory:** Personal Epistemology (Hofer & Pintrich, 1997) + Situated Cognition
- **Model:** Four-Dimensional Framework of Epistemic Beliefs
  - Certainty of Knowledge
  - Simplicity of Knowledge
  - Source of Knowledge
  - Justification for Knowing
- **Methodology:** Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA)

## Study Design
- **Participants:** 3-4 librarians with diverse cognitive orientations
- **Data Collection:** Semi-structured interviews (45-60 minutes)
- **Analysis:** IPA thematic coding
- **Output:** LinkedIn article + potential academic publication

## Related Work
This study builds on research in personal epistemology across professions (medicine, nursing, education) but represents the first qualitative phenomenological study of librarians' epistemological beliefs.
